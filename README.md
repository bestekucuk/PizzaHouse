# PIZZAHOUSE
Object-Oriented Programming Project Assignment

1- PURPOSE OF THE ASSIGNMENT:

The aim is to create an order automation system by following the given UML diagram and utilizing the principles of object-oriented programming.

2- SCOPE OF THE ASSIGNMENT:

In this project, we developed a pizza ordering application by following the UML diagram. We used an SQL database to store data. We created the classes and objects as specified in the UML diagram. We designed two different login screens, one for customers and another for the admin. In the customer login, we saved the customer's name and address in the database. We also saved and added the customer's orders to the cart using the database. Finally, in the payment section, after selecting one of the three different options and successfully entering the verification code, the payment is completed.
In the admin login, we performed operations like adding, deleting, and updating products using the SQL database.
